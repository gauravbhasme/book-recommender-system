# Book Recommender System

### Overview
Welcome to Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommender for Books! This machine-learning project is designed to provide personalized book recommendations using the Collaborative Filtering technique. 

### How it works
Collaborative Filtering is divided into two main types: User-Based and Item-Based.

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on users' preferences similar to the target user.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on the similarities between items, suggesting books similar to those the user has liked.
